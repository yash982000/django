Django 3.2.4 release notes
==========================

*Expected June 2, 2021*

Django 3.2.4 fixes two security issues and several bugs in 3.2.3.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where a final catch-all view in the admin didn't
  respect the server-provided value of ``SCRIPT_NAME`` when redirecting
  unauthenticated users to the login page (:ticket:`32754`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 where a system check would crash on an abstract
  model (:ticket:`32733`).

* Prevented unnecessary initialization of unused caches following a regression
  in Django 3.2 (:ticket:`32747`).

* Fixed a crash in Django 3.2 that could occur when running ``mod_wsgi`` with
  the recommended settings while the Windows ``colorama`` library was installed
  (:ticket:`32740`).
  
* Fixed a bug in Django 3.2 that would trigger the auto-reloader for template
  changes when directory paths were specified with strings (:ticket:`32744`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash of auto-reloader with
  ``AttributeError``, e.g. inside a ``Conda`` environment (:ticket:`32783`).
